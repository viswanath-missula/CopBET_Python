I recommend against setting it to `True` unless you specifically want the timeseries of each target saved along with each entropy result. `parallel` determines whether parallel workers are implemented for complex computations (recommended, especially for DCC). `NRU_specific` is intended to allow the original developers to bypass user input and make use of their pre-defined directories (you would probably never set this to `True`)."

The `savedata` parameter for each function is just to choose whether you want the results saved in a .csv in the provided directory `dir_name`. The default is `True`. Feel free to cross-check the entropy values produced by the Python code with those from the MATLAB functions (just note that the order of the files is different, so the order of the entropies is as well)."
